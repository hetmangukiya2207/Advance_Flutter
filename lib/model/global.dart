    info:
        'Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.',

  plantes(
      name: 'Earth',
      image: 'assets/earth.png',
      info:
          'While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.'),
  plantes(
    name: 'Jupiter',
    image: 'assets/jupiter.png',
    info:
        'Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiters stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.',
  ),
  plantes(
      name: 'Mars',
      image: 'assets/mars.png',
      info:
          'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.'),
  plantes(
      name: 'Mercury',
      image: 'assets/Mercury.png',
      info:
          'Mercury is an extreme planet in several respects. Because of its nearness to the Sun—its average orbital distance is 58 million km (36 million miles)—it has the shortest year (a revolution period of 88 days) and receives the most intense solar radiation of all the planets.'),
  plantes(
      name: 'Neptune',
      image: 'assets/neptune.png',
      info:
          'Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planets mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.'),
  plantes(
      name: 'Saturn',
      image: 'assets/saturn.png',
      info:
          'Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturns. Saturn also has dozens of moons.'),
  plantes(
      name: 'Uranus',
      image: 'assets/uranus.png',
      info:
          'Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.'),
  plantes(
      name: 'Venus',
      image: 'assets/venus.png',
      info:
          'Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earths closest planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid.'),
